ARC (Alkali.ne Rydberg Calculator)  is package of routines written in Python,
using object-oriented programming (OOP) to make modular, reusable and extendable
collection of routines and data for performing useful calculations of
single atom and two-atom properties, like level diagrams, interactions and
transition strengths for alkali and alkaline earth metal atoms.
